A ready-to-use cropping workflow that combines AsterUI layout and form components with a lightweight crop selection flow.

<Example title="Image Cropper" description="Upload an image, adjust the crop, preview the result, and download the cropped file." source={ImageCropperDemoSource} fn="ImageCropperDemo">
  <ImageCropperDemo client:load slot="demo" />
</Example>

## Features

- **Upload and replace** - Swap the source image without leaving the flow
- **Aspect presets** - Switch between freeform, square, and wide crops
- **Live preview** - Review the cropped output as you adjust the selection
- **Download action** - Save the cropped image as a PNG
- **Grid layout** - Ready for dashboard or profile settings pages

## Customization Ideas

- Wrap the cropper in a Modal or Drawer for focused editing
- Add a circular crop preset for avatars
- Persist crop state in a form or profile API
- Add size limits and guidance for upload formats
