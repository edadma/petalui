Components and hooks for building responsive layouts based on screen size.

## Import

```tsx
import { Show, Hide, useBreakpoint } from 'asterui'
```

## Breakpoints

AsterUI uses the same breakpoints as Tailwind CSS:

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `xs` | 0px | Extra small screens |
| `sm` | 640px | Small screens |
| `md` | 768px | Medium screens |
| `lg` | 1024px | Large screens |
| `xl` | 1280px | Extra large screens |
| `2xl` | 1536px | Double extra large screens |

## Examples

<div class="examples">

<Example title="Show Above Breakpoint" description="Show content only at medium screens and above." source={ResponsiveDemoSource} fn="ShowAboveDemo">
  <ShowAboveDemo client:load slot="demo" />
</Example>

<Example title="Hide Below Breakpoint" description="Hide content on small screens." source={ResponsiveDemoSource} fn="HideBelowDemo">
  <HideBelowDemo client:load slot="demo" />
</Example>

<Example title="Show At Specific Breakpoints" description="Show content only at specific breakpoints." source={ResponsiveDemoSource} fn="ShowAtDemo">
  <ShowAtDemo client:load slot="demo" />
</Example>

<Example title="Show Between Breakpoints" description="Show content within a range of breakpoints." source={ResponsiveDemoSource} fn="ShowBetweenDemo">
  <ShowBetweenDemo client:load slot="demo" />
</Example>

<Example title="Responsive Layout" description="Build different layouts for mobile and desktop." source={ResponsiveDemoSource} fn="ResponsiveLayoutDemo">
  <ResponsiveLayoutDemo client:load slot="demo" />
</Example>

<Example title="useBreakpoint Hook" description="Access breakpoint info programmatically." source={ResponsiveDemoSource} fn="UseBreakpointDemo">
  <UseBreakpointDemo client:load slot="demo" />
</Example>

</div>

## API

### `Show` / `Hide`

| Property | Description | Type | Default |
|----------|-------------|------|---------|
| `children` | Content to show/hide | `React.ReactNode` | - |
| `above` | Show/hide at this breakpoint and above | `Breakpoint` | - |
| `below` | Show/hide below this breakpoint | `Breakpoint` | - |
| `at` | Show/hide at exactly this breakpoint (or array of breakpoints) | `Breakpoint \| Breakpoint[]` | - |
| `between` | Show/hide between two breakpoints (inclusive) | `[Breakpoint, Breakpoint]` | - |

### `useBreakpoint`

Returns an object with the following properties:

| Property | Description | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `breakpoint` | Current active breakpoint | `Breakpoint` |
| `width` | Current window width in pixels | `number` |
| `isAbove(bp)` | Returns true if current breakpoint >= bp | `(bp: Breakpoint) => boolean` |
| `isBelow(bp)` | Returns true if current breakpoint < bp | `(bp: Breakpoint) => boolean` |
| `isAt(bp)` | Returns true if current breakpoint === bp | `(bp: Breakpoint) => boolean` |
| `isBetween(min, max)` | Returns true if current breakpoint is between min and max (inclusive) | `(min: Breakpoint, max: Breakpoint) => boolean` |

## Notes

- `Show` and `Hide` use JavaScript to detect the breakpoint, not CSS media queries
- Only one condition prop (`above`, `below`, `at`, or `between`) should be used at a time
- The hook updates on window resize to track the current breakpoint
- Server-side rendering defaults to 1024px width (lg breakpoint)
